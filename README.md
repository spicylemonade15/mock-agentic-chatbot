# Agentic Chatbot  

### 🚀 Introduction  
**Agentic Chatbot** is a proof-of-concept chatbot that simulates *agentic behavior*. Given a complex user query, it automatically breaks it down into smaller subtasks and routes them to relevant (mock) agents. Each agent logs its progress in the chat, mimicking a multi-agent workflow.

### 🧩 How It Works  
1. The **user query** is processed by the LLM (Gemini).  
2. The LLM generates a structured **JSON output** containing subtasks and the corresponding agent responsible for each subtask.
3. The generated subtasks and formatted and displayed to the user.  
4. A **subtask router** calls the relevant (mock) agent for each subtask.
5. Each agent logs its progress into the chat, ensuring the assistant responds only when all subtasks are completed.

### ✨ Features  
- Dynamic subtask generation based on user queries  
- Agent-based subtask execution & logging  
- Real-time chat interface with progress updates  
- Modular design for plugging in real agents later

### 📌 Future Improvements  
- Integrate real APIs/agents instead of mock logging  
- Support parallel execution of subtasks  
- Persistent session state for long-running tasks  
- Improved visualization of subtask progress
